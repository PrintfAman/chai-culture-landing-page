## 🎨 Design Rationale

**Premium Coffee House Aesthetic:**
Inspired by modern coffee shop websites like Koffuu, I created a sophisticated split-screen layout with warm, earthy tones (#f5ebe0 cream, rich browns #3e2723, #8B4513). The design balances elegance with approachability.

**Hero Layout with Integrated Signup:**
Rather than center-alignment, I used a two-column design: compelling brand story on the left, beautiful signup form on the right. The form features a dark overlay with subtle patterns and light inputs, creating high contrast that naturally draws the eye to the call-to-action.

**Polished Micro-interactions:**
Staggered entrance animations, bouncing "Launching Soon" indicators, smooth hover effects, and form transitions create a premium, professional experience. Every interaction feels intentional and refined, matching the quality of the brand promise.
