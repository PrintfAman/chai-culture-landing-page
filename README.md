## 🎨 Design Choices

**1. Premium Coffee House Aesthetic**
Inspired by high-end coffee shop websites, I created a sophisticated two-column layout with a warm, earthy color palette (#f5ebe0 cream, rich browns #3e2723, #8B4513). The design feels modern yet timeless, similar to the "Koffuu" reference with its refined elegance and approachable luxury.

**2. Hero Layout with Integrated Form**
Rather than a center-aligned approach, I used a split-screen design: compelling copy on the left, beautiful signup form on the right. The form features a dark overlay with subtle patterns, creating depth and visual interest while maintaining excellent readability. This layout pattern is proven effective in modern landing pages.

**3. Thoughtful Animations & Micro-interactions**
Staggered entrance animations, bouncing dots for "Launching Soon", smooth hover states, and form interactions create a polished, professional feel. The form's dark background with light inputs creates high contrast and draws attention to the call-to-action without being aggressive.
